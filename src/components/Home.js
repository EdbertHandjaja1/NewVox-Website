// //         NewVox is a startup based out of Evanston, IL. All of our members are united by a single goal: To improve the quality of life for those afflicted with Aphasia by reimagining the current augmented and alternative communication technologies.   
// //         <br></br>
// //         <br></br>
// //         NewVox was founded by Adithya Sathyamurthy, a neuroscience major with a strong background in communicative disorders Northwestern University, in December of 2023. His passion for Aphasia was ignited when he had the opportunity to sit in an Aphasia support group. Through this he realized how those afflicted often had their independence stripped away from them, causing a dramatic shift away from many of their previous responsibilities and joys in life.
// //         <br></br>
// //         <br></br>
// //         With our relentlessly driven team and the resources Northwestern provides us, we have made great strides in developing our technology and look forward to being able to implement it on the market soon.

// //           <p>
// //           When Adithya was able to talk to patients firsthand, one complaint was perpetuated by everyone he spoke to: The lack of adequate technology to aid them in communication. None of the current AAC (augmented and alternative communication) technologies were specific towards Aphasia users, and they were often clunky and difficult to use. Furthermore, they were all quite costly, and oftentimes not even covered by insurance. 
// //           <br></br>
// //           <br></br>
// //           Aphasia is a very unique condition and absolutely deserves its own technology. We hope to fill in that gap in the market at an affordable price.
